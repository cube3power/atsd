## Parser Configuration Description

| Field | Setting | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Enabled  |  Set to true  |  Enable parsing of CSV files using this.<br>Also allows use of this parser configuration in Axibase Collector.  |
|  Name  |  Unique name – Halifax Weather.  |  Unique name to distinguish this parser from others.<br>Useful when working with Axibase Collector, as parser configurations are referred to by their unique name.  |
|  Put Type  |  Metric  |  The CSV file in question contains time series (metrics) weather data.  |
|  Delimiter  |  Comma  |  A comma is used to separate columns.  |
|  Default Entity  |  Unique entity name – Halifax  |  All data will be written to this unique entity, making it easy to distinguish from others.  |
|  Metric Prefix  |  Unique entity prefix- halifax  |  Prefix added at the start of metric name, used to distinguish between metrics with similar or identical names.  |
|  Timestamp Columns  |  Date  |  The `Date` column contains the timestamp.  |
|  Timestamp Pattern  |  `yyyy-MM-dd`  |  Timestamp Pattern must correspond to the original timestamp in the CSV file: `2015-01-01`.  |
|  Filter  |  `timestamp > 0`  |  Only import data that has a timestamp greater than 0 in epoch milliseconds.<br>Timestamps earlier than `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` will not be imported.  |
|  Ignored Columns  |  `Year`<br>`Month`<br>`Day`<br>`Data Quality`<br>`Max Temp Flag`<br>`Min Temp Flag`<br>`Mean Temp Flag`<br>`Heat Deg Days Flag`<br>`Cool Deg Days Flag`<br>`Total Rain Flag`<br>`Total Snow Flag`<br>`Total Precip Flag`<br>`Snow on Grnd Flag`<br>`Dir of Max Gust (10s deg)`<br>`Dir of Max Gust Flag`<br>`Spd of Max Gust (kmh)`<br>`Spd of Max Gust Flag`  |  Columns that will not be imported.<br>Year, Month, Day are irrelevant because Date column is imported as the timestamp.<br>Other listed columns do not contain valuable data or often contain empty values, so its best to discard them.  |
