# Messages: Delete

## Description

The ability to delete specific message records via the Data API is not implemented.

## TTL

The messages are deleted from the database by background tasks once their insertion time is older than current time minus the time-to-live (TTL) interval.

The TTL is displayed on the **Settings: Server Properties** page, under the `messages.timeToLive` setting. It's measured in seconds.

The message expiration time is calculated based on its **insertion** time, and not based on its **record** time.

## Modifying the Default TTL

Convert the desired TTL to seconds, for example `14 days` is `14 * 24 * 3600 = 1209600`.

Login into the ATSD server and execute the following administrative commands in HBase shell one by one to modify the TTL attribute.

> The procedure is different in distributed installations.

```sh
echo "disable 'atsd_message'" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

echo "alter 'atsd_message', NAME => 'c', TTL => 1209600, MIN_VERSIONS => 0" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

echo "alter 'atsd_message', NAME => 'e', TTL => 1209600, MIN_VERSIONS => 0" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

echo "alter 'atsd_message', NAME => 'm', TTL => 1209600, MIN_VERSIONS => 0" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

echo "alter 'atsd_message', NAME => 't', TTL => 1209600, MIN_VERSIONS => 0" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

echo "enable 'atsd_message'" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

echo "major_compact 'atsd_message'" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell

```

The response should look as follows:

## Deleting All Messages

Truncate the 'atsd_message' table which will cause all records to be removed.

```sh
echo "truncate 'atsd_message'" | /opt/atsd/hbase/bin/hbase shell
```
