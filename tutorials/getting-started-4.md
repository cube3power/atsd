Update Time field value to a later timestamp and insert a value smaller than 50. Verify that the alert was deleted.

To receive alert notifications via email, configure the [mail client](../administration/mail-client.md) which is accessible at the **Settings > Mail Client** page and specify notification rule on the **Email Notifications** tab in the rule editor.
