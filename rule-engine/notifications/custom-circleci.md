# CircleCI Integration

## Overview

The following example demonstrates how to trigger a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) build for a Github project using a [`CUSTOM`](custom.md) web notification in the ATSD rule engine.

The integration relies on the [Circle CI API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v1-reference/#new-build-branch) `new-build-branch` method for triggering a new build of the specified branch.

## Configuration

Create a new `CUSTOM` web notification from scratch or import the following [template](resources/custom-circleci-notification.xml), used in this example. To import an XML template file, open **Alerts > Web Notifications**, select **Import** in the multi-action button located below the table and follow the prompts.

To create a new notification, open **Alerts > Web Notifications** and click **Create**.

### Parameters

Enter a name and specify the following parameters:

| **Name** | **Value** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Method | `POST`  |
| Content Type | `application/json` |
| Authentication | `Basic` |
| Username | `<CIRCLE_USER_TOKEN>` |
| Endpoint URL | `https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/<GITHUB_USER>/${project_name}/tree/${branch}` |
| Headers | `Accept: application/json` |

Modify the `Endpoint URL` by replacing the `<GITHUB_USER>` field with your GitHub user name.

The `Endpoint URL` should look as follows: `https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/axibase/${project_name}/tree/${branch}`

Enter the Circle CI user token into the `Username` field but leave the `Password` field empty.

Keep the `${project_name}` and `${branch}` placeholders in the URL path so that they may be customized in the rule editor. This will allow you to trigger builds for different projects using the same web notification.

### Payload

The web notification can be configured to send a JSON document to the Circle CI endpoint in order to pass extended build parameters and the `Body` field can include the following text:

```json
{
  "parallel": "${parallel}",
  "build_parameters": {
    "RUN_EXTRA_TESTS": "${run_extra_tests}",
    "timezone": "${timezone}"
  }
}
```

Make sure that you enclose fields with double quotes, if necessary.

Leave the `Body` field empty for non-parameterized projects.

## Rule

Create a new rule or import the [rule template](resources/custom-circleci-rule.xml) used in this example. To import an XML template file, open the **Alerts > Rules** page, select **Import** in the multi-action button located below the table and follow the prompts.

To create a new rule, open the page **Alerts > Rules** and click **Create**.

Specify the key settings on the **Overview** tab. 

| **Name** | **Value** |
| :-------- | :---- |
| Status | Enabled |
| Metric | test_m |
| Condition | `value > 1` |

Open the **Web Notifications** tab.

Set **Enabled** to **Yes** and choose the previously created web notification from the **Endpoint** drop-down.

Enable **Open** and **Repeat** triggers. Set the **Repeat Interval** to **All**.

Specify the same settings for the **Open** and **Repeat** triggers:

| **Name** | **Value** |
| :-------- | :---- |
| `branch` | master |
| `parallel` | 4 |
| `project_name` | atsd-api-java |
| `run_extra_tests`  | false |
| `timezone`  | Etc/UTC |

Note that these parameters are visible in the rule editor because their placeholders are present in the `Endpoint URL` and JSON payload.

When the notification is executed, all placeholders in the request URL and the payload will be resolved as follows:

`https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/axibase/atsd-api-java/tree/master`

```json
{
  "parallel": "4",
  "build_parameters": { 
    "RUN_EXTRA_TESTS": "false",
    "timezone": "Etc/UTC"
  }
}
```

If the placeholder is not found, it will be replaced with an empty string.

## Test

Test the integration by submitting a sample `series` command on the **Data > Data Entry** page.

```ls
  series e:test_e m:test_m=2
```

![](images/rule_test_commands.png)

The value will cause the condition to evaluate to `true`, which in turn will trigger the notification.
To verify that an alert was raised, open the page **Alerts > Open Alerts** and check that an alert for the `test_m` metric is present in the **Alerts** table.

Check the CircleCI user interface to make sure the target build was triggered.
