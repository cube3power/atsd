# Getting Started: Part 5

## SQL

OpenÂ the SQL console:

![](./resources/getting-started-5_1.png)

Enter the following query, modify the `datetime` condition:

```sql
SELECT entity, metric, datetime, value
  FROM "my-metric"
WHERE entity = 'my-entity'
  AND datetime >= '2018-02-01T00:00:00Z'
ORDER BY datetime
```

Modify the query to add aggregation and groupings:

```sql
SELECT entity, datetime, MAX(value), COUNT(value)
  FROM "my-metric"
WHERE entity = 'my-entity'
  AND datetime >= '2018-02-01T00:00:00Z'
GROUP BY entity, PERIOD(1 HOUR)
  ORDER BY datetime
```

Review the [SQL syntax](../sql/README.md) and experiment by executing your own queries.
