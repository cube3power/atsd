# Data Retention

Retention settings provide a way to control database size by automatically removing old data as well as discarding unnecessary data before it is stored on disk.

## Default Retention Settings

| **Data Type** | **Data Table Name** | **Retention** |
|---|---|---|
| Series | `atsd_d` | Not deleted. |
| Properties | `atsd_properties` | Not deleted. |
| Messages | `atsd_message` | [Deleted](../api/data/messages/delete.md) after `messages.timeToLive` seconds.<br>Default is 1 year. |

## Data Tables

Current data table sizes are displayed on the **Settings > Storage > Database Tables** page, in the 'Store File Size' column.

The table which stores time series data is `atsd_d`.

![](images/retention-atsd_d-size.png)

Click on the 'Store File Size' value to view file size growth over time. The size of the `atsd_d` table varies throughout the day as compaction / pruning tasks defragment and delete data in the background.

 ![](images/retention-atsd_d-chart.png)

To view daily changes in tabular format, open the 'ATSD' portal in the top menu. The table widget in the bottom left corner contains both the current table size as well as the daily change.

## Space Usage Breakdown

While the breakdown of space usage within the `atsd_d` is not available, the database provides a top-N view consisting of most frequently collected series.

The 'Top Inserts' table is accessible on the **Settings > Receive Statistics** page.

![](images/retention-top-inserts.png)

You can refer to this view in order to identify series with the largest amount of data being inserted.

## Retention Settings

The amount of time series data stored in the database may be controlled using one of the following methods:

* [Disabling](#disable-metric) the metric.
* Disabling metric [persistence](#disable-persistence).
* Applying [filters](#set-persistence-filter) to discard values for matched series.
* Deleting [expired data](#delete-expired-data) outside a specified retention period.
* Deleting [expired series](#deleted-expired-series) if no data has been received for the series within a specified retention period.

Since the data is deleted by staged [background tasks](#scheduled-tasks), it may take a few days for any new settings to fully materialize as appreciably reduced disk usage.

### Disable Metric

If the metric is **disabled**, its data is discarded when received. The data commands for disabled metrics are also _not processed_ in the rule engine.

To disable a metric, open the Metric Editor, expand 'Settings' section, set 'Enabled' switch to 'No', and click **Save**.

![](images/retention-metrics-disabled.png)

Alternatively, use [group editor](#group-editor) to modify multiple metrics at once.

Discarded commands for disabled metrics are logged with `DISABLED_METRIC` flag in the 'commands_discarded.log' listed on the **Settings > Diagnostics > Server Logs** page:

```ls
2018-03-29 05:56:21,087;DISABLED_METRIC;series e:nurswgvml502 ms:1522302980000 t:collector=bosun.org/cmd/scollector/collectors.c_ipcount_linux t:os=linux m:scollector.collector.duration=0.003668194
```

> Note that existing data already stored in the database for a disabled metric will not be automatically removed from disk.

### Disable Persistence

If a metric is **non-persistent**, it is not stored on disk. The metric will still be _processed_ in the rule engine.

To disable persistence for a metric, open the Metric Editor, expand 'Settings' section, set 'Persistent' switch to 'No', and click **Save**.

![](images/retention-metrics-non-persistent.png)

Alternatively, use [group editor](#group-editor) to modify multiple metrics at once.

Discarded commands for non-persistent metrics are logged with a `NON_PERSISTENT_METRIC` flag in the 'commands_discarded.log':

```ls
2018-03-29 05:56:21,518;NON_PERSISTENT_METRIC;series e:nurswgvml010 ms:1522302981000 t:refid=124.216.164.14 t:remote=37.58.57.238 m:ntp.stratum=2
```

> Note that existing data already stored in the database for a non-persistent metric will not be automatically removed from disk.

### Set Persistence Filter

To selectively discard some series generated by the metric, define a **persistence filter** [expression](../api/meta/expression.md).

Only series that satisfy the condition are stored on disk. All series for this metric will still be _processed_ in the rule engine.

To set the filter for a metric, open the Metric Editor, expand the 'Settings' section, enter an expression into the 'Persistence Filter' field, and click Save.

![](images/retention-metrics-persistence-filter.png)

Alternatively, use [group editor](#group-editor) to modify multiple metrics at once.

Discarded commands for metrics with persistence filters are logged with a `FILTERED_METRIC` flag in the 'commands_discarded.log':

```ls
2018-03-29 05:56:28,075;FILTERED_METRIC;series e:nurswgvmw016 ms:1522302699000 t:method=copy t:site=DefaultWebSite m:iis.requests=0
```

> Note that existing data already stored in the database will **not** be automatically removed from disk, even if the series no longer matches the filter.

#### Filter Examples

* Discard (do not persist) series with tag 'site' equal to 'DefaultWebSite'

  ```javascript
  tags.site != 'DefaultWebSite'
  ```

* Discard series with tag 'id' starting with 'lo'

  ```javascript
  tags.id not like 'lo*'
  ```

* Discard series with tag 'disk' equal `/boot` or starting with '/run'

  ```javascript
  tags.disk != '/boot' && tags.disk NOT LIKE '/run*'
  ```

* Discard series if tag 'mount_point' matches any element in named collection 'ignore-collector-mount-points'.

  ```javascript
  !likeAny(tags.mount_point, collection('ignore-collector-mount-points'))
  ```

  ```
  /boot
  /dev*
  /proc*
  /run*
  /var*
  /sys/fs/cgroup
  ```

* Discard series if tag 'id' is contained in named collection 'filesystem_ignore'.

  ```javascript
  !collection('filesystem_ignore').contains(tags.id)
  ```

  ```
  /run
  /run/shm
  /dev
  /run/lock
  /boot
  ```

### Delete Expired Data

To delete **old data** beyond the retention period for the selected metric, open the Metric Editor, expand the 'Settings' section, and set the **Retention Days** field to a positive integer, click Save.

To disable deletion, set the **Retention Days** field back to zero.

![](images/retention-metrics-edit.png)

This will cause expired data, older than current time minus the specified retention period, to be deleted by a [background task](#scheduled-tasks) which is executed once a day during nighttime hours.

#### Group Editor

In order to apply this setting to multiple metrics at once, open the Metrics tab and enter a pattern for matching multiple metrics by name.

![](images/retention-metrics-search.png)

Check individual records or select all records by checking the box in the header.

![](images/retention-metrics-select.png)

Open the group editor and modify the 'Retention Days' setting. To disable deletion, set 'Retention Days' to zero.

![](images/retention-metrics-group-edit.png)

### Delete Expired Series

To delete **all data** for an old series, open the Metric Editor, expand the 'Settings' section, and set the **Series Retention Days** field to a positive integer, click **Save**.

To disable deletion, set the **Series Retention Days** field back to zero.

![](images/retention-metrics-edit.png)

Alternatively, use [group editor](#group-editor) to modify multiple metrics at once.

This setting causes all data to be deleted for those series which have not received new values for more than the specified number of days. If the series has recent data, no data for such a series is deleted. This setting cleans the database from old/discontinued series while retaining all data for active series.

If **Series Retention Days** were set to '1 year' in the example below, it would cause 3 highlighted series that have not been updated since 2015/2016 to be deleted. The data for the remaining active series would be left untouched.

![](images/retention-series-retention.png)

The data will be deleted by a [background task](#scheduled-tasks) which is executed once a day during off-peak hours.

## Scheduled Tasks

The expired data is deleted from the database on a schedule which is synchronized with other data management tasks.

![](images/retention-scheduled-tasks.png)

The sequence of tasks should be as follows:

1. delete.schedule
2. expired.series.removal.schedule
3. expired.data.removal.schedule
4. data.compaction.schedule
5. hbase.compaction.schedule

It is recommended that the tasks are executed once a day during off-peak/nighttime hours. The `hbase.compaction` task should run once a week on large clusters.

To trigger these tasks manually, open **Settings > Storage > Delete Tasks** and execute them manually.

## Deleting Data using API

* Metric [delete](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/api/meta/metric/delete.md)
* Entity [delete](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/api/meta/entity/delete.md)
* Properties [delete](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/api/data/properties/delete.md)
* Message [delete](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/api/data/messages/delete.md)

## Deleting Data using API Clients

* Refer to Python client [examples](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-api-python#record-cleanup)

## Summarizing Expiring Data

To retain statistical averages based on expiring detailed data, use [scheduled SQL](../sql/scheduled-sql-store.md) queries with the **Store** option.

Schedule the queries to execute before the raw data is deleted.

In the example below, the query runs every night (at 00:15) to calculate hourly averages and maximums for each series in the underlying metrics.

![](images/retention-summarize.png)

The derived metrics are then stored under new names.

![](images/retention-summarize-result.png)

```sql
SELECT datetime, entity, tags.*,
  -- specify derived metric names, e.g. {metric}_{function}_{period}
  ROUND(AVG(value), 0) AS "disk_used_avg_1h",
  ROUND(MAX(value), 0) AS "disk_used_max_1h"
  -- specify metric with raw data to summarize
FROM disk_used
  WHERE datetime >= previous_day AND datetime < current_day
  -- choose summarization period, such as 1-hour
GROUP BY entity, tags, PERIOD(1 HOUR)
```

## Understanding Data Growth

In addition to more data being collected for existing series, data may be appear for new metrics, entities, and series.

In order to monitor these key parameters, create a new [portal](../portals/portals-overview.md#create-portal) with the following table widget:

![](images/retention-record-growth.png)

The widget displays the current number of records as well as weekly change.

`last.series.count.{period}` metrics display how many series were updated recently, within the specified period.

```ls
[widget]
  type = table
  timespan = 1 week
  entity = atsd

  column-entity = null
  column-time = null

  [column]
    key = value
    label = Value   
  [column]
    key = delta
    label = Weekly Change
    series-value = delta()

  [series]
    metric = last.metric.count
  [series]
    metric = last.entity.count
  [series]
    metric = last.series.count
  [series]
    metric = last.series.count.1h
  [series]
    metric = last.series.count.1d
  [series]
    metric = last.series.count.1w
```
