# Monitoring Metrics using Database Tables

Database Table statistics can be viewed directly in the ATSD user interface under
**Settings > Storage > Database Tables**.

Database Tables allow you to:

- View the size of individual tables and their partitions, both in memory and on disk.
- View the number of read and write requests in order to identify hot spots – regions of the table receiving a disproportionate amount of queries.
