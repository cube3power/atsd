# Portals

Portal is a collection of time-series [widgets](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/) created using the [Axibase Charts](https://github.com/axibase/charts#axibase-charts) and presented in a [grid](portal-settings.md#layout) layout.

The Axibase Charts library provides a simple yet powerful syntax, closely integrated with the ATSD [data model](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/data-model/), so that even a user with no programming experience can build and deploy real-time dashboards with minimal effort.

Syntax Examples:

* [70 lines](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/3230deb6/8/)
* [200 lines](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/2ef08f32)

The power user, on the other hand, can leverage [inheritance](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/inheritance), [wildcards](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/wildcards/), [control structures](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/control-structures), [computed series](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/computed-metrics), [display filters](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/display-filters), and other [advanced features](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/) to create data-driven applications such as [data sliders](https://apps.axibase.com/slider/energinet-2017/?slide=1), [cross-filters](https://apps.axibase.com/cross-filter/?table=Linux%20Performance), [statistic viewers](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/cde99874/2/#fullscreen) etc.
