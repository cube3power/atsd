### Issue 4778

The alert details table can embedded into the target document using the same format as the host document.

```javascript
${detailsTable('markdown')}
${detailsTable('ascii')}
${detailsTable('html')}
${detailsTable('property')}
${detailsTable('csv')}
${detailsTable('json')}
```

### Issue 4772

The new settings automatically creates as many series as there are incoming series to simplify the initial configuration. For `message` and `property` commands, the setting is set to 'No Tags'.

### Issue 4765

The derived command action allows storing new calculated metrics in the database by executing custom command templates in the [Network API](../../api/network/README.md) syntax.

```ls
series e:${entity} m:jvm_memory_free_avg_percent=${round(100 - avg(), 3)}
```

The new commands can be executed at the frequency of incoming commands or decreased with a custom repeat interval.
